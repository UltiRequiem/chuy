Set alias to long commands and speed up your workflow,
inspired in tools like [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli).

Although Chuy is written in Python, it can be used for projects of any language,
and even folders that are not projects!

**Note:** this tool is actively used by its primary author.

## Install

You can install [Chuy](https://pypi.org/project/chuy) from PyPI like any other package:

```bash
pip install chuy
```

To get the last version:

```bash
pip install git+https:/github.com/UltiRequiem/chuy
```

If you use Linux, you may need to install this with sudo to
be able to access the command throughout your system.

## Example Configuration file

```json
{
  "format": "poetry run black .",
  "lint": "poetry run pylint chuy tests",
  "tests": "poetry run pytest",
  "package": "poetry build && poetry publish"
}
```

This configuration must be in a [`chuy.json`](./chuy.json) file.
Usually this file goes in the root of your project but it can really go anywhere.

## Usage

After having defined the commands in the [chuy.json](./chuy.json) file,
you can now execute them as follows:

```bash
chuy format
 $ poetry run black .
 ....
```

This varies depending on the commands you
have written in the [chuy file](#example-configuration-file).

```bash
chuy lint
 $ poetry run pylint chuy tests
 ....
```

You can also pass multiple commands:

```bash
chuy lint format tests
 $ poetry run pylint chuy tests
 ....

 $ poetry run black .
 ....

 $ poetry run pytest
 ....
```

### Tricks

If you do not pass any command, you will get a menu with all the available commands,
then you will be asked which of them you want to execute,
here you can pass more than one command if you want.
